Full Source Code for Data Storytelling with HTML5

## DESCRIPTION
This is a completely free source code for web-based Data Storytelling. I used [slides template from freehtml5.co](https://freehtml5.co/slides-free-responsive-horizontal-slides-template/) and did some touchups. The data displayed in the app was derived from https://bengkulu.bps.go.id/.

The features this app has are as follows:
1. Smooth storytelling with jQuery effect
2. Line charts and bar charts appearing in the popup dialog
3. Bilingual feature, switch from Indonesian to English, visa versa

## HOW TO ENJOY
Before using this code, you gotta make sure you have your local server ready (such xampp or wamp), IDE (I use VSCode), and git installed on your computer.

1. Open your terminal in ```htdocs``` (if you use xampp) or ```www``` (if you use wamp)
2. Run this code to clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/khansasafira19/sk-cool-storytelling.git```
3. Access the folder using ```cd sk-cool-storytelling```, still in your terminal
4. That's it, the app should run now. Access it on http://localhost/sk-cool-storytelling/
